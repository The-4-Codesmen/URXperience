## Project Idea
A Web Application for University Of Regina(UofR) Residence, a digital community for the U of R Residence Students. It is a digital community for U of Residence Students to stay notified about events hosted by U of R Residence and join these events, students can join a community based on their faculty and help each other out academically, students can connect and make friends, applications also provides faculty based resources/residence based resources [Where the faculty is located/number/emails and residence contacts/emails/locations], and other cool features that will make living on residence fun such as the food feature which provides students with food recipes and food locations close to the U of R Residence. 

## Business Opportunity
Currently U of R Residence does not have a dynamic application that brings U of R Students together. There is an application for U of R Residence however it is outdated and requires a major upgrade. We believe this is an opportunity for us to build an application for U of R residence that not only replaces the old application but also enhances the experience of living on campus.  Not just U of R, we believe that with this application we have the opportunity to go beyond U of R and share this digital ecosystem with other University Residences as well
