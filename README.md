## Project Idea
For our capstone project we are building a web application for UR residence. Students living in residence can interact online, meet friends, and achieve academic success thanks to URXperience. This website application enables communication amongst students through a chat feature and keeps them informed of current events taking place on campus via a digital event planner. In addition, a digital complaint box will make life at residence more comfortable by allowing problems or complaints to potentially be remedied right away. Students living on campus can feel more at home by ordering takeout or preparing meals at home thanks to the additional options that URXperience offers, such as Recipe of the Day and nearby restaurants. With the help of this digital hub, students living on campus should have a better experience and get closer as a unit.

## Business Opportunity
Currently U of R Residence does not have a dynamic application that brings U of R Students together. There is an application for U of R Residence however it is outdated and requires a major upgrade. We believe this is an opportunity for us to build an application for U of R residence that not only replaces the old application but also enhances the experience of living on campus.  Not just U of R, we believe that with this application we have the opportunity to go beyond U of R and share this digital ecosystem with other University Residences as well.
