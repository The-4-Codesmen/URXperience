## Project Idea
For our capstone project we are building a web application for U of R residence. We are building a digital platform that allows U of R Residence students to connect with each other, make friends, help each other out academically, and be part of residence life. With our web application students will also be updated about events that are taking place at U of R Residenc, not only this our application also provides faculty based resources/residence based resources [Where the faculty is located/number/emails and residence contacts/emails/locations]. We have also added other cool features that will make living on residence fun such as the food feature which provides students with food recipes and food locations close to the U of R Residence. It does not matter where the students are from and how strong their network is, with this application we can decrease that social gap and give a digital platform for students to broaden their network at U of R. This is how we will be innovating the campus life for students and make living on campus fun and social for all students.  

## Business Opportunity
Currently U of R Residence does not have a dynamic application that brings U of R Students together. There is an application for U of R Residence however it is outdated and requires a major upgrade. We believe this is an opportunity for us to build an application for U of R residence that not only replaces the old application but also enhances the experience of living on campus.  Not just U of R, we believe that with this application we have the opportunity to go beyond U of R and share this digital ecosystem with other University Residences as well
